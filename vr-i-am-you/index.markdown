# Research

## Research

* If not 360, what then?
* What about traditional cinematography/editing?
   * Disembodied panning/dolly moves feel wrong
   * Cuts are jarring
   * Have to become the character (ala Being John Malkovich)
* Developed end-to-end workflow for first-person VR experiences

# Production

## Production

* Shooting
   * no equipment visible - have to hide
   * all one take
* Actors:
   * choreography/training
   * also wearing camera rig
   * dialog improvised

# Future work

## Future work

* Continue shooting content
* Port to more devices
* Streamline hardware and software workflow
* Expand interactivity

# Advice

## Advice

* Timeline more like a software/research project
   * Tools unavailable
   * Techniques unknown
   * A lot of work will be scrapped
* Iterate with small achievable goals, and don't stray
* To create a compelling cinematic experience for VR, the story should stand on
  it own in traditional cinema, but can be hightened in VR.
* Technology and art have to go hand-in-hand. You can't think of a story and
  bolt on VR after the fact. You shouldn't chase particular hardware if it
  doesn't directly solve a problem for your film.
